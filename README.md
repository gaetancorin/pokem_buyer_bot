# Pokem_Buyer_Bot

# Introduction
This project is a Pokem buying bot designed to purchase Pokem products faster than other buyers.

Hereâ€™s what it does during a standard purchase:
- Logs in with the selected account on the merchant Pokem website
- Continuously checks for the availability of the target product (while not logged in)
- Once the product is available, adds it to the cart (while logged in)
- Verifies the cart
- Automatically fills in the checkout form
- Selects the delivery method (pickup point option works!)
- Places the order

(Note: To ensure that only my friends and I use this bot, the word "poke e mon" is referred to as "pokem" throughout the repository to avoid being indexed on GitHub. The project remains public so my friends can access it.)
